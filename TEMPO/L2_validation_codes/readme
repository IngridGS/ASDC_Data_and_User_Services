This folder contains codes for comparison between TEMPO L2 retrievals of total ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and formaldehyde columns and corresponding retrievals from Pandora. Ozone validation code also uses DSCOVR EPIC L2 total O3 column.

The first versions of the codes do not take into account quality flags from either TEMPO or Pandara data sets.
