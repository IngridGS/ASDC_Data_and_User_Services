DSCOVR_EPIC_L4_TrO3_vs_tolnet_clim_vs_pandora.py compares ozone columns from DSCOVR_EPIC_L4_TrO3_01 ozone (O3) product,
Pandora total ozone, and integrated TOLNET CLIM tropospheric columns.
The code is driven by the user provided list of TOLNET clim files that should be pre-downloaded.
Necessary DSCOVR_EPIC_L4_TrO3_01 and Pandora files are downloaded on the fly.
Since JPL Table Mountain facility is the only place where Pandora sun-photometer and TOLNET lidar are co-located, the code makes comparison there.
However, the general case of arbitrary location hosting both instruments was also developed, but has been commented out.
Please follow comments inside to change back to the general case.
The code return plots of time series of DSCOVR EPIC total O3 column and Pandora total O3 column and
tropospheric O3 DSCOVR EPIC column and tropospheric O3 integrated from TOLNET_CLIM profile.
